# CIRRENT™ Console for Cloud ID

The CIRRENT™ Console is the web app that you use to make use of CIRRENT™ Cloud ID services. You can read more about the CIRRENT™ Console here, including the ability to add and remove users. In this section we list some points pertinent to Cloud ID users.

## User roles for Cloud ID

There are two CIRRENT™ Console roles that pertain to Cloud ID users:

**Cloud ID user**:  Users with this role can only bind devices to their corporate account.  This role is typically used for users in a manufacturing facility or warehouse, solely to bind devices for the Product Company that they represent.  

**Administrator**: An administrator can perform all the actions of a Cloud ID user. The administrator role is required to download Manifest Files, to configure APIs and to trigger device provisioning into the API if needed. This is a back-office task that involves advanced Cloud ID skills and access to cloud infrastructure.  


## Creating a user

Users with the administrator role can create new users and assign either the Cloud ID user role or the Administrator role to that user. To add a user, simply navigate to **Account Settings** and **Users**. Click **Add User** to open the **Create User** dialog box and complete the requested fields – selecting the correct user role.

Administrators can also manage users in the User Management panel, including assigning different roles to users and removing users.



## Switching between accounts

Where a specific user has access to more than one Cloud ID account the user can easily switch between accounts while staying logged into CIRRENT™ Cloud ID. Simply navigate to the desired account by using the drop down next to your username at the top right of the CIRRENT™ Console page.

Doing so could be practical where a specific user is responsible for binding devices across more than one Product Company.
