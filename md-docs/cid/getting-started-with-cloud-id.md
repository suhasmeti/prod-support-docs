# Getting Started with Cloud ID

Getting started with Cloud ID is simple. What’s more, Cloud ID is highly customizable to adjust to your manufacturing process. You can also easily test CIRRENT™ Cloud ID simply by registering an account with CIRRENT™ Cloud ID, and using the sample Product Batch IDs to test the functionality of CIRRENT™ Cloud ID. View the Cloud ID virtual developers kit here.


## Integrating Cloud ID into your manufacturing process 

You have several options when it comes to ensuring that only genuine, authorized devices gain access to your Product Cloud. CIRRENT™ Cloud ID is a solution that provides a practical, affordable, secure route to ensuring device authentication.

To integrate Cloud ID into your manufacturing process you need to ensure that your devices include a Cloud ID-compatible chip. During the manufacturing process, you install Cloud ID-compatible chips into your devices to enable device authentication via Cloud ID. When you receive a batch of chips and when these chips are ready for installation, you or your contract manufacturer simply needs to scan a QR code, or manually enter the Product Batch ID into CIRRENT™ Console to “bind” the devices with CIRRENT™ Cloud ID. 

Exactly what happens after binding a device depends on how you configure your CIRRENT™ Cloud ID solution, but the net result is that Cloud ID informs your Product Cloud that a batch of devices were bound to your account and that these devices should be allowed to communicate with the Product Cloud. The Cloud ID process ensures that only genuine, authorized devices are allowed to communicate with your Product Cloud.


## Integrating Cloud ID with your Product Cloud

Key to the functionality of Cloud ID is the ability of Cloud ID to communicate with your Product Cloud to automate the device provisioning process. We support most common cloud configurations, including:

* Standard cloud environments such as AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform
* IoT-specific cloud platforms including AWS IoT, Azure IoT
* Your private cloud configuration

Steps to configuring your Product Cloud API to accept data from CIRRENT™ Cloud ID will vary depending on the exact configuration of your Product Cloud. Once your Product Cloud is correctly configured, you simply add it to CIRRENT™ Cloud ID. We provide complete instructions on adding a cloud API to the CIRRENT™ Console in this section. Finally, you have the option to manually or automatically provision devices into your Product Cloud. You can also provision any specific device or batch of devices into multiple Product Clouds.
