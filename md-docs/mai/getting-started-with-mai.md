# Getting started with MAI

Getting started with MAI is easy, hassle-free and secure. To get started, [register for a free account](https://cirrent.infineon.com/login). The next step is to integrate the CIRRENT™ Mobile App SDK into the Android or iOS app that connectes to your IoT device, which on average takes less than two hours and less than 50 lines of code. Once integration is complete, simply watch the data flow into the CIRRENT™ Console, a secure dashboard that provides deep visibility into the performance of your IoT products.

**Key terms**

Some of the key terms you should know before you start to include the CIRRENT™ Mobile SDK in your app include:

* **AppID:** Each app instance has a unique AppID that is provided by customer
* **OnboardingID:** Each onboarding attempt is assigned a unique OnboardingID by the CIRRENT™ Mobile SDK.
* **DeviceID:** A unique ID for each connected product


**Sample App and SDK repos**

You can find sample apps and the SDK repos for Android and iOS here.

* [Android Sample App](https://github.com/Cirrent/ZipKey-Android-App)
* [iOS Sample App](https://github.com/Cirrent/ZipKey-iOS-App)

SDK (binaries) repos:

* CIRRENT™ Mobile SDK [for Android](https://github.com/Cirrent/ZipKey-Android-SDK)
* CIRRENT™ Mobile SDK [for iOS](https://github.com/Cirrent/ZipKey-iOS-SDK)


**App permissions**

You will need to ask the user of the mobile device on which your app is installed for the following app permissions in order for the CIRRENT™ SDK to be able to collect the data needed for MAI:

* **iOS**: Location and Local Network (iOS 14 and later).
* **Android**: Location

**Steps to getting started with MAI**

1.  Register for an account on CIRRENT™ Cloud. 

    Registration is free and you can do so via this link. Registering automatically creates a user profile on CIRRENT™ Cloud, and gives you full access to CIRRENT™ Console.

2.  Integrate the CIRRENT™ Mobile SDK into your mobile app

    You need to integrate the CIRRENT™ Mobile SDK into your mobile app in order to start collecting data for CIRRENT™ MAI. We provide links to sample apps and the SDK binaries below. 

3.  Reviewing your analytics on CIRRENT™ Console

    Once data starts steaming in from the CIRRENT™ Mobile SDK you will be able to review a range of onboarding analytics across all your devices, and drill down into device specific analytics too. You can read more about the CIRRENT™ Console here.


## Using CIRRENT™ MAI within your app


### Create Analytics JWT

The connected product mobile app will use a JSON web token (JWT) to confirm its scope of control when it calls the CIRRENT™ cloud. The App API Key and Secret are generated using CIRRENT™ Console using link  https://console.cirrent.com/api-keys . Please click “Create API Key” button and choose key type as “app” as shown below.

![image](../img/image-1.png)

Using the App API Key and Secret, you will need to generate [Analytics token](analytics-token-generation.md) .

Please use one of these options to generate analytics JWT token:

1. Generate the token using your cloud and sign with App API Secret.

OR

2. Generate the analytics JWT token using the SDK.

    ```
    /**
     * Method that generates Analytics JWT token.
     *
     * @param expiresIn Token lifetime in seconds.
     * @param accountId Account Id.
     * @param appId App Id.
     * @param appKey App key.
     * @param appSecret App secret key.
     * @return The output of this method will be “{appKey}::{JwtToken}”.
     */
    public static String createToken(int expiresIn, String accountId, String appId, String appKey, String appSecret)
    ```

### Add SDK Functions to the app

It is useful to look at the SDK functions as two separate categories:

**I. Init Function**

It is possible to get started within minutes by using only the Init Function. Using just the Init function provides a way to get quick time to value from CIRRENT™ Mobile SDK. Note that any communication between the app and CIRRENT™ cloud needs an analytics JWT token.

Android:

```
    /**
     * Required method that initializes Mobile Application Intelligence. Must be called before any other MAI methods.
     * Starts the SDK Captures and sends the phone information (phone model, OS), and the Wi-Fi information used
     * to identify router, ISP, SSID for the network, etc.
     *
     * In case of failure to send collected data:
     * - All unsent data will be saved in the app-specific storage. The SDK will try to send stored
     * data during next API calls;
     * - {@link MaiCallback#onTokenInvalid(Retrier)} or {@link MaiCallback#onFailed(MAIError)}
     * will be called.
     *
     * @param appContext Application Context.
     * @param token      Analytics token.
     * @param callback   {@link MaiCallback}
     */
    public static void init(Context appContext, String token, MaiCallback callback)
```

**Information about MAICallback:**

The ``init()`` has a ``MaiCallback`` parameter.

``MaiCallback`` is an abstract class which you can extend once(e.g in your base class) and just reuse. It has the following methods:

```

 public abstract class MaiCallback {
    /**
     * Called when token is invalid.
     *
     * @param retrier Allows you to pass a new token and resend collected data.
     *                In case of {@link MobileAppIntelligence.Retrier#retry(String)} failure
     *                {@link MaiCallback#onFailed(MAIError)} will be called.
     */
    public abstract void onTokenInvalid(MobileAppIntelligence.Retrier retrier);

    /**
     * Will be called when:
     * - {@link MobileAppIntelligence.Retrier#retry(String)} is failed to resend data using a new token;
     * - the conditions for calling the method are not met(e.g. attempt to call
     * {@link MobileAppIntelligence#endOnboarding()} before {@link MobileAppIntelligence#startOnboarding(int)} etc.);
     * - data hasn't been sent due to some issues on the cloud side.
     *
     * @param e An object that contains information about failure causes.
     */
    public void onFailed(MAIError e) {
        final MAIError.Type errorType = e.getType();
        MAILog.w(
                "MAI",
                String.format(
                        "%s, errorCode: %s, message: %s",
                        errorType.toString(),
                        e.getErrorCode(),
                        e.getMessage()
                )
        );
    }
 }
```

iOS:

```

    /// Required method that initializes MobileAppIntelligence. Must be called before any other MAI methods.
    /// Starts the SDK Captures and sends the phone information (phone model, OS), and the Wi-Fi information used
    /// to identify router, ISP, SSID for the network, etc.
    ///
    /// In case of failure to send collected data:
    /// 1.) All unsent data will be saved in the app-specific storage. The SDK will try to send stored data during next API calls;
    /// 2.) `onTokenInvalid(Retrier)` or `onError(MAIError)` will be called.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - analyticsToken: Analytics token
    ///   - onTokenInvalid: Will be called if token is invalid.
    ///   - retrier: Allows you to pass a new token and resend collected data. In case of failure `onError(MAIError)` will be called.
    ///   - onError: (Optional) Will be called when: 1. `Retrier.retry(token: String)` is failed to resend data using a new token; 2. the conditions for calling the method are not met(e.g. attempt to call `enterStep(thisStepName: String, reason: String? = nil)` before `startOnboarding()` etc.).
    ///   - error: An object that contains information about failure causes.
    public static func initialize(token: String, onTokenInvalid: @escaping (_ retrier: Retrier) -> (), onError: ((_ error: MAIError) -> ())? = nil)
```
**II. Onboarding related functions**

These functions help capture data related to particular onboarding. A single try of one app instance onboarding one Wi-Fi connected device is considered to be a unique *OnboardingID*. It is essential to use ``startOnboarding()`` and ``endOnboarding()`` functions to identify the start and end of a unique *OnboardingID*.

The SDK gives the app developers flexibility to decide on which steps in the app to collect data. App developers can also annotate moving from one step to the next with reason codes.

Android:

```

    /**
     * Required method that tells the cloud that onboarding has been started.
     * Also creates a unique onboarding id and stores it for subsequent calls.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method is not allowed and
     * you will receive {@link MaiCallback#onFailed(MAIError)} in the following cases:
     * - if {@link #init(Context, String, MaiCallback)} wasn't called;
     * - if onboarding already started and you try to call it again without
     * calling {@link #endOnboarding()} or {@link #endOnboarding(EndData)}.
     * <p>
     * In case of failure to send collected data:
     * - All unsent data will be saved in the app-specific storage. The SDK will try to send stored
     * data during next API calls;
     * - {@link MaiCallback#onTokenInvalid(Retrier)} or {@link MaiCallback#onFailed(MAIError)}
     * will be called.
     *
     * @param onboardingSessionTimeout if the time gap between onboarding steps > this value then
     *                                 onboarding duration timers will be paused till the next
     *                                 step is performed.
     *                                 By default this value = {@link #DEFAULT_ONBOARDING_SESSION_TIMEOUT}
     */
    public static void startOnboarding(int onboardingSessionTimeout)

    /**
     * Required method that tells the cloud that onboarding has been started.
     * Also creates a unique onboarding id and stores it for subsequent calls.

    public static func create(result: StepResult, stepName: String, reason: String) -> StepData

    /// Adds a debug info to the `StepData` object.
    ///
    /// - Parameter debugInfo: debug info that you want to add to the `StepData` object.
    /// - Returns: `StepData` object.
    public func setDebugInfo(_ debugInfo: [String: String]) -> StepData

``EndData`` class helps to form information about the end of current onboarding and consist of the following functions:
```

Android:

```

    /**
     * Creates a failed onboarding {@link EndData} object.
     *
     * @param failureReason reason of failure.
     * @return {@link EndData} object with a reason of failure.
     */
    public static EndData createFailure(@NonNull String failureReason)

    /**
     * Adds a debug info to the {@link EndData} object.
     *
     * @param debugInfo debug info that you want to add to the {@link EndData} object.
     * @return {@link EndData}
     */
    public EndData setDebugInfo(@NonNull Map<String, String> debugInfo)
```

iOS:

```

    /// Creates a failed onboarding `EndData` object.
    ///
    /// - Parameter failureReason: reason of failure.
    /// - Returns: `EndData` object with a reason of failure.
    public static func create(failureReason: String? = nil) -> EndData

    /// Adds a debug info to the `EndData` object.
    ///
    /// - Parameter debugInfo: debug info that you want to add to the `EndData` object.
    /// - Returns: `EndData` object.
    public func setDebugInfo(_ debugInfo: [String: String]) -> EndData
```

#3 Using MAI in practice

1.  **Single line of code to collect Phone and Wi-Fi Environment details**

To get only environmental details such as Phone OS / model, app version and Wi-Fi environment details such as router, ISP, etc, you need to use only one function call

Android:

`
    MobileAppIntelligence.init(appContext, token, callback);
`

iOS:

```
    MobileAppIntelligence.initialize(token: token, onTokenInvalid: onTokenInvalid, onError: onError)
```

2.  **Getting success rates and onboarding durations**

This example allows the app developers to understand how many onboarding attempts succeeded and what is the duration that a user spent to onboard a device to Wi-Fi. This allows developers to also see what was the last step that the user was on before abandoning in case of unsuccessful onboarding attempts.

Java-based example:

```
    //#1
    MobileAppIntelligence.init(appContext, token, callback);

    //#2
    MobileAppIntelligence.startOnboarding(OnboardingType.SOFTAP);

    //#3a
    MobileAppIntelligence.endOnboarding();

    //OR

    //#3b
    MobileAppIntelligence.endOnboarding(EndData.createFailure("SoftAP_web_Server_timeout_error"));
```

However, this example will not give details on what is the order of steps that the user takes before the end of onboarding.

3.  **Understand which steps cause users to abandon onboarding and why**

You will need to annotate the various onboarding steps with step names to understand where users abandon the process. Consider SoftAP onboarding process shown below where the user goes through a series of steps such as scanning for a device, connecting to SoftAP SSID, and then going to the step where the user enters private Wi-Fi network credentials. At this step, let’s say the user spent too much time entering his Wi-Fi password and gets a timeout error from the SoftAP connected device. As CIRRENT™ SDK captures all steps and their duration all this information allows developers to understand the root cause of the issue. A similar approach can be used for onboarding steps for BLE.

Java-based example:

```

    //#1
    MobileAppIntelligence.init(appContext, token, callback);

    //#2
    MobileAppIntelligence.startOnboarding(OnboardingType.SOFTAP);

    //#3
    MobileAppIntelligence.enterStep(StepData.create(StepResult.SUCCESS, "scanning_for_device", "onboarding_started"));

    //#4
    MobileAppIntelligence.enterStep(StepData.create(StepResult.SUCCESS, "connecting_to_device", "device_found"));

    //#5
    MobileAppIntelligence.enterStep(
                    StepData.create(
                            StepResult.SUCCESS,
                            "entering_private_creds",
                            "joined_soft_ap_ssid"
                    ).setDebugInfo(
                            new HashMap<String, String>() {
                                {
                                    put("softap_ssid", "ssid_name");
                                }
                            }
                    )
    );

    // <Getting a timeout error from the SoftAP connected device>

    //#6
    MobileAppIntelligence.endOnboarding(EndData.createFailure("SoftAP_web_Server_timeout_error"));
```

4.  **Adding App Version using Custom Attributes**

Custom attributes enable an app developer to add specific pieces of data that might be relevant to understanding the onboarding performance. A typical example is App Version.

Java-based example:

```

    MobileAppIntelligence.setOnboardingDeviceInfo(deviceId, getAppVersion());

    Map<String, String> getAppVersion() {
        final Map<String, String> appVersion = new HashMap<>();
        appVersion.put("app_version", BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME);
        return appVersion;
    }
```
