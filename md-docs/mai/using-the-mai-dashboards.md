On the top right, you can choose the time period that you’d like to view.

Then, starting at the top left corner, you will see various tiles holding data, charts,
etc. Below are descriptions of each tile and what they mean for your products.

For a deeper dive into any of the charts, just click on a point within the box and it will
take you to another page with more details.


On the left side of your screen, you will see the App  Inspector under Product Operations. Only Console  Users with Operations privilege have access to App  Inspector.  

## Onboarding Steps

The app inspector displays your customized onboarding steps and shows the success and  failure rate at each step of the process. You can use this information to see how long it  takes a user to go through the entire onboarding process, where are the major bottlenecks  and work with your team to create a smoother user onboarding experience.
