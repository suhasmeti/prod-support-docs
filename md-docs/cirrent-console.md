# CIRRENT™ Console

> **_NOTE:_** CIRRENT™ Console is now INFINEON OSTS Console. [View our announcement here](cirrent-osts.md) to understand what's changed. 


## CIRRENT™ Console User Architecture

### Users

In the CIRRENT™ Console a user represents an individual person in a company. Every user is defined by a unique email address. Infineon manages users and user authentication with a login at myInfineon. These credentials applies to the CIRRENT™ services, the Infineon community, and other Infineon services.

### Accounts

An account represents a unique collection of devices. A device can only be associated with one account. Each user may be a member of multiple accounts. 
When you log into the CIRRENT™ Console, you’ll be asked to select an account to access, or you may be given the ability to create a new account. 

If you are the person creating a new account you will automatically be the administrator on the new account, and you will be able to add users to the new account as needed.

### Roles

Each user in an account can be assigned one or more roles. The roles available to assign are:

* **Developer role:** allows users to log in to the console and see data for devices on the account

* **Operations role:** allows a user to add Device Types and Devices to an account

* **Cloud ID role:** a role specific to CIRRENT™ Cloud ID customers, enables the user to bind compatible devices to their Cloud ID account

* **Administrator role:** includes the ability to create or delete users, create and delete API keys


## Managing Users

You can add new users and modify the details of existing users in the **User Management** section. Simply navigate to **Account Settings** and **Users**.
